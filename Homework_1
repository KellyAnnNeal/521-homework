Homework 1


Task 1:
Michael M. Pollock, George R. Pess, Timothy J. Beechie & David R. Montgomery (2004) The Importance of Beaver Ponds to Coho Salmon Production in the Stillaguamish River Basin, Washington, USA, North American Journal of Fisheries Management, 24:3, 749-760, DOI: 10.1577/M03-156.1


Task 2:
I like this paper since it is quantifying the effect of beavers on salmon, clearly shows the study location and measurements they took to quantify the effect of beavers,
and show the difference in effect temporally within year and across large time scales. I think if they had included more on the effect on redds, the individual effect of
beaver ponds on different parameters that specifically impact juvenile sockeye salmon, and included the age of beaver ponds this would be a more hollistic study on how beavers 
impact salmon within this river basin.
