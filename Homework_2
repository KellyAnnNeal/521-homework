Homework 2


I am using Mendeley as my reference manager. I like how easily it imports references and their papers into my reference library. 
I wish it had a way to have nested organizational structure instead of just one level for grouping papers. 
I had google scholar set up to send me papers that include both the terms "beaver salmon" and "beaver climate change".
